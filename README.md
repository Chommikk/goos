** Features
1. Minimal design - no diodes, LEDs, OLEDs
2. Ultra low-profile and transportable
3. Colemak DH with home row mods -- really comfy

The philosophy of the layout revolves around toggeling between layers to make up for only having 36 keys.

Base layer - 1:
- Colemak Mod-DH.
- Home-row modifiers to have the modifier keys at the most comfortable positions.

Symbol layer - 2:
- All the needed symbols

Number layer - 3:
- Inspired by Pnohty's numpad+, I reversed the order of the numbers so the lowest digits are in the most comfortable positions (following Benford's law)
- Media/Brightness controls
- Arrow keys for navigation in combination with modifier keys

For mac I have magnet setup for window management with these settings:
